# 💓 Capstone Project: Heart Disease Data Analysis

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a heart disease dataset using Python. The goal is to uncover patterns and correlations between patient health indicators and the presence of heart disease.

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)
- Records: 303
- Features: Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Cholesterol, Max Heart Rate, etc.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python (Google Colab)
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## 📊 Key Steps
- Data Cleaning and Encoding
- Handling Missing Values
- Visualization with Seaborn/Matplotlib
- Correlation Analysis
- Observations and Insights

## 🔍 Insights
- Heart disease is more common in males.
- Patients above age 50 are at higher risk.
- Specific chest pain types and low max heart rate are associated with heart disease.

## ✅ Outcome
The project demonstrates how Python can be used to clean and analyze real-world medical data, extract meaningful patterns, and communicate findings effectively.
